# COVID-19-Diagnosis-System
Detect Covid-19 using Deep Learning from X-Ray/CT scans of patients.


## Dataset

### COVID-19

Images used in training are from different recent publications as these are the images that are already available
- Collected and Shared by: Dr Joseph Paul Cohen. Postdoctoral Fellow, Mila, University of Montreal],

### Normal Images

- Dataset: Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia), 
- https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
- It has two types of X-Ray images Normal and Pneumonia but only normal X-Rays have been used from this dataset so that Model learns to identify Covid-19 cases.
